# Equations of motion for seismic wave propagation in elastic and acoustic media

In this module I summarize some parts of the `Theory of elastic waves` lecture, especially the equations of motion to describe seismic wave propagation in elastic media, as well as 1D/2D medium approximations. Furthermore, analytical 
solutions are derived to validate the accuarcy of seismic modelling codes, implemented during the course of the lecture.

## Lecture 1: Theory of seismic wave propagation

### [Lesson 1](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/daniel-koehn/Theory-of-seismic-waves-II/tree/master/01_Analytical_solutions/1_Equations_of_motion_elastic_medium.ipynb): Equations of motion for an elastic medium

Equations of motion for an elastic medium: conservation of momentum, generalized Hookes law. What changes are required to model seismic wave propagation in anisotropic or visco-elastic media on the local or global scale, in 
time- or frequency domain? Different notations of the elastic equations of motion.

Stress-strain relation for isotropic elastic media and how to compute it using the symbolic math library **SymPy**. 3D equations of motion for seismic wave propagation in isotropic elastic media.

### [Lesson 3](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/daniel-koehn/Theory-of-seismic-waves-II/tree/master/01_Analytical_solutions/3_Acoustic_medium.ipynb): 3D acoustic medium approximation

Estimation of 3D isotropic acoustic wave equation from the isotropic elastic equations of motion.

Introducing the 2D elastic PSV/SH and acoustic problem. Getting rid of one dimension and derive the 1D elastic SH and acoustic wave equations.
