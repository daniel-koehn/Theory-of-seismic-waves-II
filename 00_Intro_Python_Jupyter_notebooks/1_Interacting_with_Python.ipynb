    "\n",
    "Python is now 26 years old. Its creator, [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum), named it after the British comedy \"Monty Python's Flying Circus.\" His goals for the language were that it be an \"an easy and intuitive language just as powerful as major competitors,\" producing computer code \"that is as understandable as plain English.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a general-purpose language, which means that you can use it for anything:  organizing data, scraping the web, creating websites, analyzing sounds, creating games, and of course _engineering computations_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language. This means that you can write Python commands and the computer can execute those instructions directly. Other programming languages—like C, C++ and Fortran—require a previous _compilation_ step: translating the commands into machine language.\n",
    "A neat ability of Python is to be used _interactively_. [Fernando Perez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Pérez_(software_developer)) famously created **IPython** as a side-project during his PhD. We're going to use IPython (the I stands for \"interactive\") in this lesson."

    "Your time is more valuable than a machine's!\n",
    "(See the Recommended Readings section at the end.)\n",

Some arguments may be optional (which means they have a default value defined inside the function), others are required. For example, the `print()` function has one required argument: the string of characters it should print out for you.\n",
